{- This should be constant time, since the underlying operations are just

{- Results for bytestrings of size integerPower 2 <$> [1..20::Integer].  The
   biggest inputs here are of size 1048576, or about 4 megabytes.  That's surely
   too big.  Maybe try [1000, 2000, ..., 100000] oor [100, 200, ..., 10000] for
   one-argument functions and [500, 1000, ..., 10000] for two-argument
   functions.


   AppendByteString : good fit for I(x+y), but underpredicts for reasonably-sized
   inputs

   EqualsByteString LessThanEqualsByteString, LessThanByteString: these all
   agree to within 2%, but the plot bends up towards the right.  You get a
   pretty good linear fit for sizes less than 250000

   ConsByteString: this does appear to be linear in the size of the string, and
   the size of the thing you're consing is irrelevant.  Again, the inputs are a
   bit too big.

   LengthOfByteString: this does appear to be pretty much constant, although
   it's hard to tell over the exponential range of scales we have here.  The
   time taken varies between 888ns and 1143ns, but randomly.  We could do with
   more data points here, and more uniformly spaced.

   IndexByteString: again this looks constant.  More uniform spacing would be
   good.

   SliceByteString: again, pretty constant.

   Overall it looks like we'd get good models with smaller and evenly spaced
   strings. We should do this but check what happens with larger inputs for
   AppendByteString.  We should also give more inputs to the single-argument
   functions.
